This is the readme file for my BrainStation capstone project on recommendation systems for Amazon clothing products. 

The data was retrieved from 'Amazon Reviews Data (2018)' by Jianmo Ni at UCSD (https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). The metadata and reviews for the 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry' category were used.

The environment used in this project is stored in `capstone.yml`.

The order of the notebooks is as follows:

    1. `products_loading_preprocessing.ipynb`: products metadata was loaded and cleaned, EDA
    
    2. `reviews_loading_preprocessing.ipynb`: reviews data was loaded and cleaned, EDA
    
    3. `popularity_rec.ipynb`: popularity recommendation system
    
    4. `content_rec.ipynb`: content recommendation system
    
    5. `colab_rec.ipynb`: collaborative recommendation system

The original json data and the csv generated in the loading_preprocessing notebooks is stored in the `Data` folder and he figures made in EDA are stored in `Images` folder.
